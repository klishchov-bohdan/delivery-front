      <h3>How Does Courier Delivery Work?</h3>
      <h4>
        The process of courier delivery depends on the company, contract, location and a variety of other factors. Either a company provides its own fulfilment to a local depot, which is then picked up by the courier and dispersed to customers, or couriers pick up packages directly from the seller.

        Couriers often pick up many different orders to deliver to a specific area or region in order to reduce overall transport and time. Through coordinating area specific deliveries, courier delivery services reduce the amount of unnecessary journeys undertaken and can perform multiple deliveries in a day.

        A company may use multiple courier services to fulfil orders, however some may stick with using one service, likely depending on area of distribution and bulk costs.

        An example courier delivery may look like this:

        Seller delivers orders to local depot
        Courier picks up orders at local depot
        Courier drives to designated area of distribution
        Courier delivers packages to customers at home/work/offices
        Courier return to local depot for more packages or shift end
